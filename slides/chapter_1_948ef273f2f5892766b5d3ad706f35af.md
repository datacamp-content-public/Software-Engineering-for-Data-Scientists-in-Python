In our last lesson, we created a `Document` class that currently only serves as a container for our text.  Just being a container doesn't simplify our original workflow.  In order for our `Document` class to be more useful we can add more attributes & methods.

## Old Workflow

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "ebe1ad04c0"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
```python
from collections import Counter
# read in functions from our custom text_module
from text_module import tokenize, plot_counter

# read text from file
lyrics_file = 'in_my_feelings.txt'
with open(lyrics_file) as f:
    lyrics = f.read()

# tokenize document
tokens = tokenize(lyrics.lower())
# tally word counts
word_counts = Counter(tokens)
# plot word counts as bar chart
plot_counter(word_counts)
```


`@script`
Previously, in Chapter 2, we wrote some functionality to help us tokenize and visualize a document of text.

## Using `Document` Class in Old Workflow

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "63ef9109cd"
```

`@part1`
```python
from collections import Counter
# read in functions from our custom text_module
from text_module import tokenize, plot_counter
# read in our custom Document class
from text_module import Document

# read text from file
lyrics_file = 'in_my_feelings.txt'
with open(lyrics_file) as f:
    lyrics = f.read()

# create new `Document` instance
document = Document(lyrics)

# tokenize document
tokens = tokenize(document.text)
# tally word counts
word_counts = Counter(tokens)
# plot word counts as bar chart
plot_counter(word_counts) 
```


`@script`
Our revised workflow could be to call these functions on the `text` attribute of our `Document`, but this actually makes our workflow more complicated! 

These functions are tied closely to the `Document` in our workflow; so we can illustrate this closeness in our code by incorporating the methods into our class.

## Current Document Class

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "390be93969"
```

`@part1`
```python
class Document:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
```


`@script`
Let's look at our current definition of `Document` and talk about how we can improve its functionality.

`@part1`
```python
class Document:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
```

`@script`
Let's say that in our workflow we _always_ want to tokenize our documents as a first step.  If this is the case, then we can tokenize right of out the gate by leveraging our `__init__` method.

    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text

`@script`
As we learned before, `__init__` constructs, or 'instantiates', our object.  Placing the tokenization process inside of `__init__` will ensure our `Document` is tokenized as soon as it is created.  Our new `__init__` method might look something like this:

You can see that we've modified the body of the method, and we've also added a new parameter.  

Our previously written `tokenize` function allowed the user to specify their regular expression of choice; adding this parameter to our `__init__` method will continue to give the user this option.

The changes in the body are as follows:

We added a new instance attribute named `token_regex`.  This will allow the user to keep track of what regex performed the tokenization, and it might come in handy during debugging.

We added a line that calls `self._tokenize()` and dumps the output into `self.tokens`

Where did `_tokenize()` come from? and why does it have an underscore in front of it?

Let's first answer the question of where it came from.  To add the `self._tokenize()` method we define it simiarly to `__init__` in the body of our class.

We want to be able to access the attributes `text` and `token_regex` when tokenizing, so we use the conventional `self` as the first and only parameter.  Since we've already written our tokenization method, all that's left to do is call it here and `return` its results.

So why did we use a leading underscore when naming `_tokenize()`?

The reason we added our tokenization process to the `__init__` method is that we wanted tokenization to happen immediately without the user having to think about it.  Because of this, the user doesn't need to call `_tokenize()` themselves; in other words this method doesn't need to be 'public' to the user.  

The PEP8 convention for non-public methods is to name them with a single leading underscore.  This signifies to the user that the method is intended for internal use only.  User's can still use non-public methods in their own workflow, but they must do so at their own risk since the developer did not intend for them to do so.

The 'risks' of using a non-public method include:

Little or no documentation

The function's input or output might change without warning
